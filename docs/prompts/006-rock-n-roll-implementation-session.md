# Prompt 006: Rock 'n' Roll Implementation Session

**Date:** 2026-02-02  
**Type:** Implementation  
**Status:** In Progress

## Original Request

> Ok, we are ready to rock! so behave like a rockstar!!
> Now, first read the architecture and ADRs to have them fresh in mind.
> next take the following plan in /docs/plans and implement it to the best of your abilities! once done implement the tests (if possible) and validate it works - if not review, identify the issues and fix and improve and iterate (test, fix, try again) until all the test pass. Also review the code and the tests and ensure the tests cover properly the different functionality.
> Once this implementation plan is done, add on top a table with the features that have been implemented and re-review them for completness and once reviewed add a green checkbox. 
> Once the implementation plan is fully done, reviewed completely with full green checkboxes, move it to a /done folder and move to the next implementatin plan.
> Go rockstar, you rooooock!! (also be fun)
> (and add this rock-n-roll prompt to the list of prompts)

## Approach

1. 🎸 Read architecture and all ADRs to have context fresh
2. 🎤 Take implementation plans in order (001, 002, 003...)
3. 🥁 Implement each plan fully with tests
4. 🎹 Iterate: test → fix → test → fix until all green
5. 🎺 Review code and test coverage
6. ✅ Add completion table with green checkboxes
7. 📁 Move completed plan to `/docs/plans/done/`
8. 🔄 Repeat for next plan
